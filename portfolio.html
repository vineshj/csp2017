	<h2> I created a simple soccer game in Scratch. This was a very elementary project as Scratch is a block based visual programming language. This game was inspired by my admiration for the game of soccer. The controls for this game are:</h2>
	<h2>-           Arrow keys to move the soccer player</h2>
	<h2>-           Space Bar to shoot the ball</h2>
	<h2><strong> CLICK ON THE TITLE TO PLAY THE GAME </strong></h2>
