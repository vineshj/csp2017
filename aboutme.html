    <h1>Welcome to Vinesh's Website!</h1>
                <h3>I am Vinesh Janarthanan</h3>
                <h2>I am an ambitious 17 year old who does not consider any dream to be elusive. I abide by the philosophy that any dream can become a reality through utter determination, hardwork, and passion. Currently I am a high achieving student attending Waukesha West High School. In the future, I wish to pursue a career in the field of BioRobotics because I find utmost interest in finding ways to apply robotic concepts to enhance or rehabilitate the human body. The hobbies that I take on with great fervor include biorobotic research, playing the violin, traveling, and coding.
